> React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript and CosmJS.

This template is based on:

- [React Native Template Typescript](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript)
- [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs)

We made this repo to solve the following issue:

- [CosmJS incompatibility with ES2018](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1144)

## ⭐ Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Minimal additional dependencies
- Default setup for CosmJS compatibility

## ⚙️ Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://github.com/nabla-studio/react-native-template-typescript-cosmjs
```

## ⚠️ React Native CLI

This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to [force npx to ignore](https://github.com/npm/npx#description) any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
